<strong>About the Owners:</strong> When we aren't working, Tammy and I (Randy) have enjoyed traveling both in the USA and abroad for decades and acquired investments in various places that we, guests, and long-stay clients can enjoy. My wife's specialty is <em>English as a Second Language</em> and I have a PhD in <em>Intercultural Studies</em>. We are both amateur musicians and have lived not only in various places in the USA, but in Central America and Asia as well.

<strong>Why We Chose These Properties:</strong> When we are looking for locations in which to invest, we think about the things that enjoyable to us and that would be attractive to other guests. For us that often means finding places near water and-or attractions. Our properties have spectacular lake /creek / or bay views. Some are near boating, swimming, and other outdoor experiences, besides various tourist locations.
